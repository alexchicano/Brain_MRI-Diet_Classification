# Brain_MRI-Diet_Classification
In this project we explore different approaches for **brain MRI classification based on Mediterranean Diet Adherence**. The goal is to classify subjects as high or low adherent to Mediterranean Diet based on their brain T1 MRI and the 14 questions of the MedAS questionnaire.

The dataset analyzed is ImaGenoma, comprising 954 subjects without cognitive impairments from which, after binary stratification based on MedAS values, we derive a balanced subset of 323 subjects for analysis. We adopt a Deep Learning (DL) approach using CNN architectures for MedAS classification, exploring different models and training settings.

# Preprocessing  
In a nutshell here's how to use this template, so **for example** assume you want to implement ResNet-18 to train mnist, so you should do the following:
- In `modeling`  folder create a python file named whatever you like, here we named it `example_model.py` . In `modeling/__init__.py` file, you can build a function named `build_model` to call your model

```python
from .example_model import ResNet18

def build_model(cfg):
    model = ResNet18(cfg.MODEL.NUM_CLASSES)
    return model
``` 

   
- In `engine`  folder create a model trainer function and inference function. In trainer function, you need to write the logic of the training process, you can use some third-party library to decrease the repeated stuff.

```python
# trainer
def do_train(cfg, model, train_loader, val_loader, optimizer, scheduler, loss_fn):
 """
 implement the logic of epoch:
 -loop on the number of iterations in the config and call the train step
 -add any summaries you want using the summary
 """
pass

# inference
def inference(cfg, model, val_loader):
"""
implement the logic of the train step
- run the tensorflow session
- return any metrics you need to summarize
 """
pass
```

- In `tools`  folder, you create the `train.py` .  In this file, you need to get the instances of the following objects "Model",  "DataLoader”, “Optimizer”, and config
```python
# create instance of the model you want
model = build_model(cfg)

# create your data generator
train_loader = make_data_loader(cfg, is_train=True)
val_loader = make_data_loader(cfg, is_train=False)

# create your model optimizer
optimizer = make_optimizer(cfg, model)
```

- Pass the all these objects to the function `do_train` , and start your training
```python
# here you train your model
do_train(cfg, model, train_loader, val_loader, optimizer, None, F.cross_entropy)
```

**You will find a template file and a simple example in the model and trainer folder that shows you how to try your first model simply.**
